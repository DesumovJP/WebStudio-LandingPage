    {
      "q": "How long does a project take?",
      "a": "We work fast, but with quality. MVP in a week, full e‑commerce — up to 3 weeks, complex product — from 3 weeks. Our experience shows: 80% of clients see first results within a week. After deep analysis of your business, we provide an exact plan with deadlines for each stage. Every project starts with a detailed spec that guarantees no misunderstandings or delays. We don't promise unrealistic deadlines — we work efficiently and transparently."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can we edit content ourselves after launch?",
      "a": "Absolutely. In Business and Scale plans, you get a powerful admin panel that works like a regular document editor — intuitively and without technical knowledge. Edit text, products, categories, blog posts, images in real time without involving developers. Convenient interface, understandable even without experience working with technical systems. We don't just provide a panel — we train your team: personal demo session, video guides, and detailed documentation. Result: you're completely independent in content management. In Starter, content is edited via code or we can add a basic admin panel."
    },
    {
      "q": "What does post‑launch support include?",
      "a": "We don't leave you after launch. First 30 days of support included in all plans: security updates, bug fixes, growth consulting, Core Web Vitals monitoring and performance, SEO optimization and analytics. In Scale plan additionally — monthly strategic consultations and priority support. Our approach: proactive support. We don't wait for things to break — we monitor your product 24/7 and prevent issues. Support details are fixed in the contract so you know exactly what to expect."
    },
    {
      "q": "How do you handle SEO optimization?",
      "a": "SEO isn't an add‑on, it's the foundation. We build it from day one using the latest practices: SSG/ISR for instant speed, structured Schema.org markup for better indexing, Core Web Vitals optimization (LCP, FID, CLS) for top Google positions. Result: our clients appear in search within 2–3 weeks after launch. Additionally, we provide a content plan, keyword strategy, and set up analytics to track positions. In Business and Scale — full Google Search Console integration, XML sitemap, robots.txt. We don't just do SEO — we ensure organic traffic that converts into clients."
    },
    {
      "q": "Do you work with existing systems (CRM, payments)?",
      "a": "Yes, and it's our strength. We integrate your site with any systems: CRM, payment systems, analytics, email marketing. If you have a custom system — we build integration to your requirements. All integrations are tested before launch and documented for your team. Result: your site becomes the central hub for all business processes."
    },
    {
      "q": "What if we need to scale the project?",
      "a": "Our architecture is ready for millions of users from the start. We use a modular approach: add new features, mobile app (React Native for iOS and Android), expand backend, integrate additional services, add multilingual support — all without rewriting code. We simply add new modules to the existing structure. Performance is optimized via caching, CDN, and horizontal server scaling. Result: your product grows with your business without technical debt or expensive rewrites. Our clients scale from startups to large companies on the same architecture."
    },
    {
      "q": "Which technologies do you use?",
      "a": "We work with the most modern and reliable industry technologies. Frontend: Next.js, React, TypeScript for web apps; React Native for mobile (iOS and Android). Backend: Node.js, Strapi CMS for admin panels, PostgreSQL database. Integrations: GraphQL and REST API. Infrastructure: Vercel, AWS, or other platforms per your preference. Modern tools: Zustand for state, Framer Motion for animations. All technologies have large communities, active support, and long‑term perspective. We don't use outdated solutions — only what ensures speed, security, and scalability."
    },
    {
      "q": "How much does a project cost?",
      "a": "Transparent pricing with no hidden fees. Starter $250 (MVP in a week), Business from $500 (e‑commerce with CMS), Scale from $750 (enterprise level). After describing your task, we provide a detailed estimate broken down by stage and options. Final price is fixed in the contract before work starts — no surprises. Payment can be per stage (before each stage starts) or split before start and before launch. Flexible terms are discussed individually. Our approach: you pay for results, not process. Every dollar is invested in your business growth."
