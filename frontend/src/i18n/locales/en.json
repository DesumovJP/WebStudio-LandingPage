  "faq": [
    {
      "q": "How long does a project take?",
      "a": "It depends on complexity and scope: a simple landing — up to 7 days (Starter), e‑commerce with CMS and admin — up to 3 weeks (Business), complex product with a design system — from 3 weeks (Scale). After a detailed task analysis we send an exact plan with deadlines for each stage: research, design, development, testing, launch. Every project starts with clarifying requirements and creating a spec to avoid misunderstandings and delays."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can we edit content ourselves after launch?",
      "a": "Yes. Business and Scale include an interactive admin panel (Strapi CMS) where you can edit text, products, categories, blog posts, images without developers. The panel is intuitive, similar to working with documents. We also onboard your team: demo session, video guides and documentation. In Starter, content can be changed in code or we can add a basic admin panel as an option."
    },
    {
      "q": "What does post‑launch support include?",
      "a": "Support includes: security and dependency updates, bug fixes, product growth consulting, Core Web Vitals monitoring and performance, SEO optimization and analytics. The first 30 days after launch are included for all plans. After that, you can continue monthly or on demand. Scale includes monthly consultations and priority support. Details are agreed on project start and fixed in the contract."
    },
    {
      "q": "How do you handle SEO optimization?",
      "a": "We lay the SEO foundation from day one. Technical optimization includes: SSG/ISR for speed, structured Schema.org markup for better indexing, Core Web Vitals optimization (LCP, FID, CLS), semantic HTML, proper meta tags and Open Graph. We also provide a content plan and strategy for organic growth, keyword strategy, and set up analytics to track positions. Business and Scale include XML sitemap, robots.txt, and Google Search Console integration."
    },
    {
      "q": "Do you work with existing systems (CRM, payments)?",
      "a": "Yes. We integrate your site with popular CRMs (HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive), payment systems (Stripe, WayForPay, LiqPay, PayPal), analytics (Google Analytics, Yandex.Metrika, Mixpanel), email marketing (Mailchimp, SendGrid), and other business tools. We use REST and GraphQL for integrations. For custom systems, we build integrations to your requirements. All integrations are tested before launch and documented for your team."
    },
    {
      "q": "What if we need to scale the project?",
      "a": "The architecture is prepared for growth from the start thanks to modern technologies (Next.js, Strapi, PostgreSQL). We can add features, a mobile app (React Native for iOS and Android), expand the backend, integrate additional services, add multilingual support, implement complex business logic. Scaling happens without rewriting code — we add modules to the existing structure. We also optimize performance via caching, CDN, and horizontal scaling when needed."
    },
    {
      "q": "Which technologies do you use?",
      "a": "Frontend: Next.js, React, TypeScript for web apps; React Native for mobile (iOS and Android). Backend: Node.js, Strapi CMS for admin and content, PostgreSQL database. Integrations: GraphQL and REST APIs. Infrastructure: Vercel, AWS, or others per your preference. We also use modern tools: Zustand for state, Framer Motion for animations. All technologies are up‑to‑date with strong communities for long‑term support."
    },
    {
      "q": "What does your process look like?",
      "a": "The process is split into stages: 1) Research — business goals, competitors, audience, USP; 2) Design — prototypes, design system, responsive layouts; 3) Development — iterative development with weekly demos; 4) Testing — devices and browsers; 5) Launch — deploy, setup, access handover. Weekly demos show progress, changes and next steps. We use Trello or other tools for transparency. Communication is via Telegram or email, as you prefer."
    },
    {
      "q": "How much does a project cost?",
      "a": "Price depends on scope and complexity. Starter from $250 (simple landing), Business from $500 (e‑commerce with CMS), Scale from $750 (complex product). After describing your task we provide a detailed estimate broken down by stage and options. Final price is fixed in the contract before work starts. Payment can be per stage or split before start and before launch. Flexible terms are discussed individually."
